## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Golden Retriever"
4. Click Install

## Getting Started

1. Create a `collections` folder in your workspace root

   ```bash
   mkdir collections
   ```

2. Create your first collection:

   - Click the Golden Retriever icon in the activity bar
   - Click the "Add Collection" button (+ icon)
   - Enter a name for your collection

3. Add requests:

   - Right-click on your collection
   - Select "Add Request"
   - Configure your request details

4. Run requests:
   - Click on any request to open it
   - Click "Send" to execute
   - View responses in the integrated response viewer

## Working with GraphQL

Golden Retriever provides dedicated support for GraphQL APIs:

1. Create a new request and select "GraphQL" from the body type dropdown
2. Use the specialized GraphQL editor with:
   - Query editor for your GraphQL operations
   - Variables editor for JSON variables
   - Automatic Content-Type header management

Example GraphQL query:

```graphql
query GetUser($id: ID!) {
  user(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

With variables:

```json
{
  "id": "123"
}
```

The extension will automatically:

- Set the method to POST
- Set the correct Content-Type header
- Format the request body according to GraphQL specifications

## Environment Variables

Golden Retriever supports environment variables through `.env` files:

1. Create a `.env` file in your workspace root
2. Add your variables:
   ```
   API_KEY=your-api-key
   BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
   ```
3. Use variables in requests with `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` syntax:

   ```
   ## api request
   {{BASE_URL}}/users?key={{API_KEY}}

   ## graphql
   {{BASE_URL}}/graphql
   ```

## Working with Local-Only Collections

If you want to create collections that remain only on your local machine and aren't committed to your repository:

1. Create a `.tmp` folder inside your `collections` directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p collections/.tmp
   ```

2. Add this folder to your `.gitignore`:

   ```
   # Add to .gitignore
   collections/.tmp/
   ```

3. Use this folder for:
   - Quick test requests with hardcoded API keys
   - User-specific test collections
   - Experimental API exploration you don't want to share
   - Local development requests that shouldn't be pushed to the repository

The `.tmp` folder will appear in your collections sidebar locally, but won't be included in your Git history or pushed to remote repositories.

## Collection Structure

Collections are stored as JSON files in your `collections` folder:

```
📁 your-project
 ┣ 📁 collections
 ┃ ┣ 📄 users-api.json
 ┃ ┣ 📄 products-api.json
 ┃ ┣ 📄 rest-api.json
 ┃ ┣ 📄 graphql-api.json
 ┃ ┗ 📁 .tmp
 ┃   ┣ 📄 local-test.json
 ┃   ┗ 📄 dev-experiments.json
 ┗ 📄 .env
```

## Using the Collection Runner

- Right-click a collection or group in the sidebar
- Select "Run Collection"
- View progress in the output channel and stats in the results panel

## Example

## FAQ

**Q: Where are my collections stored?**  
A: Collections are stored as JSON files in the `collections` folder of your workspace. This allows them to be version controlled with your project.

**Q: Can I import Postman collections?**  
A: Yes! Golden Retriever uses Postman/Newman compatible collection format. Just copy your Postman collection JSON into a file in your `collections` folder.

**Q: Does it support both REST and GraphQL APIs?**  
A: Yes! The extension provides dedicated support for both REST and GraphQL APIs, with specialized editors for each type.

**Q: How do I switch between REST and GraphQL modes?**  
A: In the request editor, use the body type dropdown to switch between "Raw" (for REST) and "GraphQL" modes.

**Q: Can I use environment variables in GraphQL queries?**  
A: Yes! You can use environment variables in both the GraphQL URL and variables using the `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` syntax.

**Q: Are my environment variables secure?**  
A: Environment variables are stored in your local `.env` file, which should be added to `.gitignore` to keep sensitive data secure. The extension supports masking sensitive data in the UI.

**Q: Can I run multiple requests at once?**  
A: Yes! Run an entire collection or group using the Collection Runner.

**Q: Does it support request chaining or response variables?**  
A: Yes! When running collection tests, use `pm.environment`. For example, set a variable with `pm.environment.set('userId', 'some_random_user_id')` in one test, then access it with `pm.environment.get('userId')` in another. Great for testing CRUD flows—just ensure requests are ordered correctly in the collection.

**Q: How do I change the collections folder location?**  
A: You can configure the collections path in VSCode settings:

1. Open vscode Settings
2. Search for "Golden Retriever"
3. Update the "Collections Path" setting

**Q: My request/collection is not updated, after extension update, why?**  
A: After each vscode golder retriever extension update you need to kinda close tab with opened request/collection and open again to see new changes. No need to close window, also tab reopening will suffice.
